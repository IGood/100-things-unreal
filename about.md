Basically, I have lots of thoughts about writing code in Unreal.

The intent of this blog is to provide bitesize recommendations for writing correct & performant code in Unreal.

The main theme here is that many things are cheap, but nothing is free.\
The computer has a lot of work to do & we should do our best to reduce that amount of work.

Other points of interest are just useful tips or gotchas to look out for.
