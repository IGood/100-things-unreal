I started learning to write software around 1999. I'm still learning.\
I have Bachelor degree in Computer Science (DigiPen Institute of Technology, 2009) & have worked as a professional game developer since 2009.\
I've worked with proprietary game engines up until 2019 when I first started using Unreal Engine 4. Now I spend most of my time writing code against the latest verion of Unreal Engine (5.3, at the time of this update).

The inspiration for this blog comes from Sean Secton's excellent [2,000 Things](https://2000things.com/) projects.\
His short posts were often just the right thing to help me find answers to problems or just learn more about the technologies I was using.\
**This** blog might not solve your problems, but can hopefully provide some useful information about the framework in which you're working.

I doubt that I'll ever come close to 1,000 posts. 2,000 is absurd for me, 100+ seemed *plausible* on a long enough timeline, & anything else in the middle didn't feel like a nice round number.

Basically, I've developed lots of opinions about writing code over the years.\
The intent of this blog is to provide bitesize recommendations for writing correct & performant code in Unreal.

At this time, the main theme of the blog is ***Many things are cheap, but nothing is free***.\
The computer has a lot of work to do & we should do our best to reduce that amount of work.\
Other points of interest are just useful tips or gotchas to look out for.
