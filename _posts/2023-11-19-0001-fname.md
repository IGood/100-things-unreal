Prefer `FName` over `FString` for case-insensitive strings that need to be compared at run time.

They use less memory & are faster to compare than `FString`.

Constructing a `FName` still isn't free.\
So for performance critial code, consider hoisting the creation of hard-coded values out of the hot code path.

```cpp
// üëç write this
static const FName NAME_Hello("hello");
if (SomeName == NAME_Hello) ...

// üëé not that
if (SomeName == "hello") ...
```

"None" is a special value for `FName` & it can be created in many different ways.\
See [UnrealNames.cpp](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/UObject/UnrealNames.cpp) for tests that demonstrate all sorts of ways that "none" can be created such that we end up with a value where `SomeName.IsNone() == true`.

A `FName` created from an empty string is "none" & therefore will not `ToString` back to an empty string.
```cpp
FName X = "";
check(X.IsNone());
check(X.ToString() != TEXT(""));
check(X.ToString() == TEXT("None"));
```
